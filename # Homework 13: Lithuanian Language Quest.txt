# Homework 13: Lithuanian Language Question Answering System

## Overview

Create a Python script that accepts a user's question, determines if it's in Lithuanian language,
and if so, provides an answer to the question using an OpenAI language model.

## Technical requirements

- use UV to initialise and store dependencies.
- Store the code in the github.

## Reference Example

See the example of using structured/JSON response in Python OpenAI at:
`samples\json-mode\json_mode_applied.py`

## Requirements

1. **User Input**

   - Create a console input that accepts a user question
   - Example: `question = input("Enter your question: ")`

2. **Language Detection Model**

   - Create a Pydantic model for language detection:

   ```python
   class LithuanianQuestionCheck(BaseModel):
       is_lithuanian_language: bool
   ```

3. **JSON Mode Implementation**

   - Use the 'response_model' parameter in chat completions to parse the response into your model
   - Make sure to set 'json_mode' correctly in your API call

4. **Language Verification**

   - Add conditional logic to check if the question is in Lithuanian language
   - Use the parsed response to make this determination

5. **Question Answering**
   - If the question is in Lithuanian, make a second API call to answer the question
   - Format the response appropriately for display to the user

## Submission

Create a Python script that implements all the requirements above.
